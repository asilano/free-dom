    # Masquerade is a little tricky. We need an action to optionally Trash,
    # which can't trigger until each player has chosen and passed a card.
    #
    # Passing a card involves choosing a card to pass left, and only then
    # receiving a card from the right (if available). This means that each
    # player's "pass left" action blocks two others (that player's "receive from
    # right", and the left player's "receive from right"). That is:
