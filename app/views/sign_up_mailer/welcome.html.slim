p Welcome to FreeDom!

p= "Thanks for registering at #{root_url}. Everything's gone through, so you're all set up."

p= "To get started, visit the main page, games_url. See if there are any games waiting for players, or create your own game."

p Whenever you're in a game, it'll update itself regularly (every minute by default). If it's a game you created then you'll be given a button to start the game as soon as at least one other player's joined the game.

p Take your turn whenever you're required to, but don't worry too much about speed of play - we're a pretty relaxed site.

p= "Finally, if you have an problems or comments, contact me on this address, or by following the instructions on the Feedback page (contact_url)."

p Oh, and Have Fun!
