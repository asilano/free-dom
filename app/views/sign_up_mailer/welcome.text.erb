Hi <%= @user.name %>,
Welcome to FreeDom!

Thanks for registering at <%= root_url %>%. Everything's gone through, so you're all set up.

To get started, visit the main page, <%= games_url %>. See if there are any games waiting for players, or create your own game. You'll be given a button to start your game as soon as at least one other player's joined.

For the moment, games don't auto-refresh for other players' actions. You can specify a Discord channel ID to allow the game to post updates there.

Take your turn whenever you're required to, but don't worry too much about speed of play - we're a pretty relaxed site.

Finally, if you have an problems or comments, contact me by replying to this email.

Oh, and Have Fun!
