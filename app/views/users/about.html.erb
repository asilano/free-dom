    ...and what's Dominion?
  </h1>
  <p>Dominion is a card game, published by <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com">Rio Grande Games</a>. Players each start with an identical personal deck of ten cards,
  and compete to gain the most points by buying additional cards for their deck. Cards bought can produce more money, allow the player to perform various actions, or
  are worth points.</p>
  <p>Rio Grande publish the rules for Dominion online, available for download as a PDF from <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278">the game's page</a>.</p>
  <h1>Which sets does Free-Dom use?</h1>
  <p>

    <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=326">Seaside</a> and

  </p>  
  <h1>What do I need to play?</h1>
  <p>
    Not much. You'll need a relatively modern web-browser with Javascript enabled. FreeDom has been verified to work in recent versions of 
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>,
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> and
    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">Internet Explorer</a> (IE 8 and later), on desktop and mobile devices.
    It's likely most other modern browsers, including mobile browsers, will also work - if you find browsers in which it works (or doesn't!) please 
    <%= link_to "let me know", contact_path %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, you'll just need to <%= link_to "register", new_user_path %>, and you're good to go.
