This is the codebase for my free, online Dominion server. In this branch, I'm rewriting it from the ground up!

Notes
-----

`master` is the main branch. Development work will be performed here (if small), or merged here when complete. It is intended that `master` is always building and passing; however, mistakes happen.

The `release` branch is the codebase as it exists on heroku.

Other branches may be created for significant items of development (such as new sets, or UI rewrites).
