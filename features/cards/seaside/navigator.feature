  Background:
    Given I am a player in a standard game with Navigator
  
  Scenario: Navigator should be set up at game start
    Then there should be 10 Navigator cards in piles
      And there should be 0 Navigator cards not in piles
  
  Scenario: Playing Navigator - discard
    Given my hand contains Navigator and 4 other cards
      And my deck contains Province x2, Duchy x3, Gold x4
      And it is my Play Action phase
    When I play Navigator
      Then I should have seen Province x2, Duchy x3
      And I should need to Choose whether to discard the seen cards with Navigator
    When I choose the option Discard seen cards
      Then I should have moved Province x2, Duchy x3 from deck to discard
      And I should have 2 cash available
      And it should be my Play Treasure phase
    
  Scenario: Playing Navigator - return same order
    Given my hand contains Navigator, Village x2, Copper x2
      And my deck contains Province x2, Duchy x3, Gold x4
      And it is my Play Action phase
    When I play Navigator
      Then I should have seen Province x2, Duchy x3
      And I should need to Choose whether to discard the seen cards with Navigator
    When I choose the option Don't discard (keep order)
      Then nothing should have happened
      And I should have 2 cash available
      And it should be my Play Treasure phase
      # No need to verify order hasn't changed explicitly as test harness does that
    
  Scenario: Playing Navigator - return, choose order
    Given my hand contains Navigator, Village, Library
      And my deck contains Adventurer, Bazaar, Chancellor, Duchy, Embargo, Gold x4

    When I choose the option Don't discard (choose order)
      Then I should need to Put a card 5th from top with Navigator
    # Choose cards in the order D B A E C, i.e. deck will be C E A B D
    When I choose my peeked Duchy
      Then the following 2 steps should happen at once
        Then I should have removed Duchy from my deck
        And I should have put Duchy on top of my deck
      And I should need to Put a card 4th from top with Navigator
    When I choose my peeked Bazaar
      And the game checks actions
      # because the deck only gets renumbered when actions are checked
      Then the following 2 steps should happen at once

        And I should have put Bazaar on top of my deck
      And I should need to Put a card 3rd from top with Navigator
